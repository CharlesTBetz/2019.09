# 2019.09
Fall semester 2019 efforts - new platform. 

*2019.09.22 update* Created full working example of Terraform creating a vm and installing a small web server on it. Clone down to the Cloud Shell, change the necessary variables internally, and run "terraform init" and "terraform apply." Last message should be an IP address; type that into your browser.
